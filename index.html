        Gary, now I know I was wrong<br>
I messed up, and now you're gone<br>
Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you<br>
Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me<br>
Feeling this empty<br>
Your meow right now would sound like music to me<br>
Please come home, 'cause I miss you, Gary<br>
Gary, come home<br>
(Gary, come home)<br>
Gary, can't you see I was blind?<br>
I'll do anything to change your mind<br>
More than a pet, you're my best friend<br>
Too cool to forget<br>
Come back 'cause we are family<br>
And forgive me for making you wanna roam<br>
And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome<br>
Somewhere I hope you're reading<br>
My latest three-word poem<br>
Gary, come home<br>
Gary, come home<br>
(Gary, come home)<br>
Gary, come home<br>
(Gary, come home)<br>
Gary, come home<br>
(Gary, come home), ah<br>
Gary, come home<br>
Gary, come home<br>
Gary, won't you come home?
